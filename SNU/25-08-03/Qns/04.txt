Problem Title:
Group Anagrams

Problem Description:
Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the original letters exactly once. Return a list of groups, where each group contains strings that are anagrams of each other.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of strings.
- The next n lines each contain a string.

Output Format:
- Print each group of anagrams on a separate line. The strings in each group should be space-separated. The order of groups and the order of strings within each group does not matter.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^4
- 1 <= length of each string <= 100
- All strings consist of lowercase English letters.
