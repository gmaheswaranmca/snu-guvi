Problem Title: Count Occurrences of Element

Problem Description:
Given a sorted array of integers and a target value, determine how many times the target appears in the array. You must use a binary search approach to achieve an efficient solution.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the sorted array.
- The third line contains an integer T, the target value to count.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer representing the number of times the target value appears in the array.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- -10^9 ≤ Array elements ≤ 10^9
- -10^9 ≤ T ≤ 10^9

Sample Input 1:
7
1 2 2 2 3 4 5
2

Sample Output 1:
3

Explanation:
The target value 2 appears three times in the array.

Sample Input 2:
5
1 1 1 1 1
1

Sample Output 2:
5

Explanation:
The target value 1 appears five times in the array.

Sample Input 3:
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
7

Sample Output 3:
0

Explanation:
The target value 7 does not appear in the array.

Sample Input 4:
8
-5 -3 -3 0 0 0 2 4
0

Sample Output 4:
3

Explanation:
The target value 0 appears three times in the array.

Sample Input 5:
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
5

Sample Output 5:
1

Explanation:
The target value 5 appears once in the array.
