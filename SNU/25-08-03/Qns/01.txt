Problem Title: Activity Selection

Problem Description:
You are given N activities with their start and end times. Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time. An activity is selected if its start time is not less than the end time of the previously selected activity.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of activities.
- The next N lines each contain two integers, S and E, representing the start and end times of an activity.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer, the maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be selected.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 0 ≤ S < E ≤ 10^9

Sample Input:
6
1 3
2 4
3 5
0 6
5 7
8 9

Sample Output:
4

Explanation:
The selected activities are (1,3), (3,5), (5,7), (8,9). These do not overlap and maximize the number of activities.
