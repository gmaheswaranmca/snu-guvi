Problem Title:
Longest Consecutive Sequence

Problem Description:
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers. The sequence can be in any order in the array, but the numbers in the sequence must be consecutive integers. Your algorithm should run in O(n) time.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

Output Format:
- Print a single integer, the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= array[i] <= 10^9

Sample Input:
7
100 4 200 1 3 2 101

Sample Output:
4

Explanation:
The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Its length is 4.

Solution Techniques:

1. Sorting Approach:
    - Sort the array.
    - Iterate through the sorted array and count the length of consecutive sequences.
    - Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting.
    - Space Complexity: O(1) if sorting in-place.

2. HashSet Approach (Optimal):
    - Insert all elements into a HashSet.
    - For each number, check if it's the start of a sequence (i.e., num - 1 not in set).
    - If so, count the length of the sequence by incrementing.
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(n)

3. Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union):
    - Use Union-Find to group consecutive numbers.
    - Find the largest group size.
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(n)
    - More complex to implement than HashSet.

4. Map-based Range Merging:
    - Use a map to track the length of sequences at their boundaries.
    - Merge sequences when a new number connects two ranges.
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(n)
