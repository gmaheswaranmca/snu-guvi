Find All Subsets of an Array
Given an array of distinct integers, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. You may return the subsets in any order.
Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.
Output Format:
- Print all subsets, one per line. Each subset should be printed as space-separated integers in non-descending order. Print the empty subset as an empty line.


Sample Input:
```
3
1 2 3
```

Sample Output:
```
1 2 3
1 2
1 3
1
2 3
2
3
```

using Bitmasking Approach, the python solution for above problem:

``` python 
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
arr.sort()
subsets = []

for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
    subset = []
    for i in range(n):
        if mask & (1 << i):
            subset.append(arr[i])
    subsets.append(subset)

# Sort subsets by length descending, then lexicographically
subsets.sort(key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))

for subset in subsets:
    print(' '.join(map(str, subset)))
print()  # Print the empty subset as an empty line
```



Detailed explanation of the code excerpt:

### Code Explanation

#### 1. Generating All Subsets Using Bitmasking

```python
for i in range(n):
    if mask & (1 << i):
        subset.append(arr[i])
subsets.append(subset)
```

- **Purpose:** This loop is part of a process to generate all possible subsets of a list `arr` of length `n`.
- **How it works:**
  - `mask` is an integer where each bit represents whether to include (`1`) or exclude (`0`) the corresponding element from `arr`.
  - `for i in range(n):` iterates over each element's index.
  - `if mask & (1 << i):` checks if the i-th bit in `mask` is set. If so, `arr[i]` is included in the current subset.
  - `subset.append(arr[i])` adds the element to the current subset.
  - After the loop, `subsets.append(subset)` adds the constructed subset to the list of all subsets.

#### 2. Sorting Subsets

```python
# Sort subsets by length descending, then lexicographically
subsets.sort(key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))
```

- **Purpose:** To order the subsets for output.
- **How it works:**
  - `subsets.sort(...)` sorts the list of subsets.
  - `key=lambda x: (-len(x), x)` sorts primarily by descending length (`-len(x)`) so longer subsets come first.
  - If two subsets have the same length, they are sorted lexicographically (dictionary order).

#### 3. Printing Subsets

```python
for subset in subsets:
    print(' '.join(map(str, subset)))
print()  # Print the empty subset as an empty line
```

- **Purpose:** To display all subsets in the required order.
- **How it works:**
  - `for subset in subsets:` iterates through each subset.
  - `print(' '.join(map(str, subset)))` prints the elements of the subset separated by spaces.
  - `print()` at the end prints an empty line, which represents the empty subset.

### Key Concepts

- **Bitmasking:** Efficient way to generate all possible combinations (subsets) of a set.
- **Sorting with Custom Keys:** Allows multi-level sorting (by length, then lexicographically).
- **Printing:** Converts each subset to a space-separated string for output.

---

### Gotchas

- **Empty Subset:** The empty subset is included and printed as an empty line.
- **Lexicographical Sorting:** Works as expected only if the elements are comparable (e.g., all integers or all strings).

---

### Example

Suppose `arr = [1, 2, 3]`. The code will generate and print:

```
1 2 3
1 2
1 3
2 3
1
2
3

```
(The last empty line is the empty subset.)
