There are several approaches to generate all subsets (the power set) of an array:

1. **Bitmasking Approach**:
    - Each subset can be represented by a bitmask of length n (where n is the array size).
    - For each integer from 0 to 2^n - 1, use its binary representation to decide which elements to include in the subset.
    - Time Complexity: O(n * 2^n)
    - Space Complexity: O(2^n)

2. **Backtracking/Recursive Approach**:
    - Use recursion to explore two choices at each step: include or exclude the current element.
    - Build subsets incrementally and backtrack.
    - Time Complexity: O(n * 2^n)
    - Space Complexity: O(2^n)

3. **Iterative Approach**:
    - Start with an empty subset.
    - For each element in the array, add it to all existing subsets to form new subsets.
    - Time Complexity: O(n * 2^n)
    - Space Complexity: O(2^n)
