**Best Solution**:
All three approaches have similar time and space complexity, but the iterative and bitmasking approaches are generally easier to implement and understand for this problem size (n â‰¤ 10). Bitmasking is especially concise and efficient for small n.

**Recommendation**:
Use the bitmasking approach for its simplicity and performance for small arrays.
