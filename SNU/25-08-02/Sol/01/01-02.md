Find All Subsets of an Array
Given an array of distinct integers, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. You may return the subsets in any order.
Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.
Output Format:
- Print all subsets, one per line. Each subset should be printed as space-separated integers in non-descending order. Print the empty subset as an empty line.


Sample Input:
```
3
1 2 3
```

Sample Output:
```
1 2 3
1 2
1 3
1
2 3
2
3
```

Backtracking/Recursive Approach
```python 
def subsets(nums, index, path, res):
    if index == len(nums):
        if path:
            print(' '.join(map(str, path)))
        else:
            print()
        return
    # Include nums[index]
    subsets(nums, index + 1, path + [nums[index]], res)
    # Exclude nums[index]
    subsets(nums, index + 1, path, res)

n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
arr.sort()
subsets(arr, 0, [], [])
```

Detailed explanation of the code excerpt:

### What the Code Does

This code generates **all possible subsets** (the power set) of a given list of integers. It uses a recursive approach to explore every combination of including or excluding each element.

---

### Line-by-Line Breakdown

#### 1. Recursive Function Calls

```python
# Include nums[index]
subsets(nums, index + 1, path + [nums[index]], res)
# Exclude nums[index]
subsets(nums, index + 1, path, res)
```

- **Purpose:**  
  These two lines are the core of the recursion. For each element at `nums[index]`, the function explores two possibilities:
  - **Include** the current element in the subset (`path + [nums[index]]`)
  - **Exclude** the current element (`path`)
- **How it works:**  
  The function calls itself with `index + 1` to move to the next element.  
  - The first call adds the current number to the subset.
  - The second call skips it.

#### 2. Input Handling

```python
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

- **Purpose:**  
  Reads input from the user.
- **How it works:**  
  - `n` is the number of elements (not used elsewhere in this snippet).
  - `arr` is the list of integers entered by the user.

#### 3. Sorting

```python
arr.sort()
```

- **Purpose:**  
  Sorts the array. This ensures that subsets are generated in lexicographical order, which is often required in subset problems.

#### 4. Initial Function Call

```python
subsets(arr, 0, [], [])
```

- **Purpose:**  
  Starts the recursive process.
- **Arguments:**
  - `arr`: The sorted list of numbers.
  - `0`: Start from the first index.
  - `[]`: Start with an empty subset (`path`).
  - `[]`: Start with an empty result list (`res`).

---

### What’s Missing?

- The actual definition of the `subsets` function is not shown in your excerpt.  
  Typically, this function would:
  - Add the current `path` to `res` at each step.
  - Print or return the result at the end.

---

### Key Concepts

- **Recursion:**  
  The function explores all possible combinations by branching at each element (include/exclude).
- **Backtracking:**  
  By passing a new list (`path + [nums[index]]`), it avoids modifying the same list in different recursive calls.
- **Power Set:**  
  The result is all possible subsets, including the empty set and the set itself.

---

### Gotchas

- **Mutable Default Arguments:**  
  If the `subsets` function uses mutable default arguments (like `res=[]`), it can cause bugs. Always pass new lists or use `None` as a default.
- **Result Handling:**  
  The result (`res`) is not printed or returned in this snippet, so you won’t see output unless the function handles it.

---

### Example

If the input is:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The code will generate all subsets of `[1, 2, 3]`:
- `[]`
- `[1]`
- `[2]`
- `[3]`
- `[1, 2]`
- `[1, 3]`
- `[2, 3]`
- `[1, 2, 3]`
