Find All Subsets of an Array
Given an array of distinct integers, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. You may return the subsets in any order.
Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.
Output Format:
- Print all subsets, one per line. Each subset should be printed as space-separated integers in non-descending order. Print the empty subset as an empty line.


Sample Input:
```
3
1 2 3
```

Sample Output:
```
1 2 3
1 2
1 3
1
2 3
2
3
```


Iterative Approach, the solution in python:

```python 
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
arr.sort()
result = [[]]

for num in arr:
    result += [curr + [num] for curr in result]

# Remove the empty subset for output order
subsets = [subset for subset in result if subset]
# Sort subsets by length descending, then lexicographically
subsets.sort(key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))

for subset in subsets:
    print(' '.join(map(str, subset)))
```

Detailed explanation of the code excerpt, step by step:

---

### 1. Input Reading

```python
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
```
- **`n = int(input())`**: Reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of elements in the array.
- **`arr = list(map(int, input().split()))`**: Reads a line of input, splits it into strings, converts each to an integer, and stores them in a list called `arr`.

---

### 2. Sorting the Array

```python
arr.sort()
```
- Sorts the array in ascending order. This ensures that subsets are generated in a consistent, lexicographical order.

---

### 3. Generating All Subsets (Power Set)

```python
result = [[]]

for num in arr:
    result += [curr + [num] for curr in result]
```
- **`result = [[]]`**: Initializes `result` with a list containing the empty subset.
- **For each `num` in `arr`**:
  - For every existing subset (`curr`) in `result`, creates a new subset by adding `num` to it (`curr + [num]`).
  - Adds all these new subsets to `result`.
- **Effect**: This is a classic way to generate all possible subsets (the power set) of the array.

---

### 4. Removing the Empty Subset

```python
subsets = [subset for subset in result if subset]
```
- Filters out the empty subset (`[]`) from `result`, since the output should only include non-empty subsets.

---

### 5. Sorting Subsets

```python
subsets.sort(key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))
```
- Sorts the subsets by:
  1. **Length descending** (`-len(x)`): Longer subsets come first.
  2. **Lexicographically** (`x`): For subsets of the same length, sorts them in ascending order based on their elements.

---

### 6. Printing the Subsets

```python
for subset in subsets:
    print(' '.join(map(str, subset)))
```
- For each subset in the sorted list:
  - Converts each integer to a string.
  - Joins them with spaces.
  - Prints the result.

---

## **Summary**

- Reads an array of integers.
- Generates all possible non-empty subsets.
- Sorts them by size (largest first), then lexicographically.
- Prints each subset on a new line.

---

### **Gotchas & Notes**
- The code uses a neat trick to generate the power set by iteratively building on existing subsets.
- Sorting by `(-len(x), x)` is a Pythonic way to achieve the desired output order.
- The empty subset is explicitly removed before output.
