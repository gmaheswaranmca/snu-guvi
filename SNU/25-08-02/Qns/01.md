Problem Title:
- Find All Subsets of an Array

Problem Description:
- Given an array of distinct integers, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. You may return the subsets in any order.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

Output Format:
- Print all subsets, one per line. Each subset should be printed as space-separated integers in non-descending order. Print the empty subset as an empty line.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10
- -10 <= array[i] <= 10
- All elements in the array are distinct.

Sample Input:
```
3
1 2 3
```

Sample Output:
```
1 2 3
1 2
1 3
1
2 3
2
3
```

Explanation:
- There are 8 subsets in total, including the empty subset (not shown above). Each subset is printed in non-descending order.

Difficulty:
- Medium
