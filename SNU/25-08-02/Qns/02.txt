Problem Title: Two Sum

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. Return the answer in any order.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the array nums.
- The third line contains an integer target.

Output Format:
- Print two space-separated integers representing the indices of the two numbers whose sum is equal to target.

Constraints:
- 2 <= n <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- Exactly one solution exists.

Sample Input:
4
2 7 11 15
9

Sample Output:
0 1

Explanation:
nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, which is equal to the target.

Difficulty:
Easy
