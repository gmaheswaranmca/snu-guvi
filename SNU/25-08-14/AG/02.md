## Introduction

**Bellman-Ford Algorithm** is a single-source shortest path algorithm that can handle graphs with negative edge weights. It was developed by Richard Bellman and Lester Ford Jr. in the 1950s.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Dynamic Programming**: Uses optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems
- **Single-Source Shortest Path**: Finds shortest paths from one source to all other vertices
- **Handles Negative Weights**: Works with negative edge weights (unlike Dijkstra)
- **Negative Cycle Detection**: Can detect negative cycles in the graph
- **Graph Type**: Works with both directed and undirected graphs

## Problem Statement

Given a weighted graph and a source vertex, find the shortest distance from the source to all other vertices. Additionally, detect if there are any negative cycles reachable from the source.

### Constraints:
- Graph can have **negative edge weights**
- Graph can be directed or undirected
- Must detect negative cycles (paths where total weight < 0)

## Algorithm Overview

### Core Idea:
1. Initialize distances to all vertices as infinity (except source = 0)
2. **Relax all edges** repeatedly for (V-1) iterations
3. Check for negative cycles by doing one more iteration
4. If any distance can still be improved, there's a negative cycle

### Key Concept - Edge Relaxation:
For edge (u, v) with weight w:
```
if distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
    distance[v] = distance[u] + w
    parent[v] = u
```

### Why (V-1) iterations?
- Shortest path can have at most (V-1) edges
- Each iteration can extend the shortest path by one edge
- After (V-1) iterations, all shortest paths are found

## Step-by-Step Process

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Initialize**:
   - Set distance to source = 0
   - Set distance to all other vertices = ∞
   - Set parent of all vertices = -1

2. **Main Loop** (Repeat V-1 times):
   ```
   For i = 1 to V-1:
       For each edge (u, v) with weight w:
           if distance[u] ≠ ∞ AND distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
               distance[v] = distance[u] + w
               parent[v] = u
   ```

3. **Negative Cycle Check**:
   ```
   For each edge (u, v) with weight w:
       if distance[u] ≠ ∞ AND distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
           return "Negative cycle detected"
   ```

4. **Result**: Distance array contains shortest distances (or negative cycle detected)

## Implementation

### Python Implementation:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.V = vertices
        self.edges = []
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v, weight):
        self.edges.append((u, v, weight))
    
    def bellman_ford(self, source):
        # Step 1: Initialize distances
        distances = [float('inf')] * self.V
        distances[source] = 0
        parent = [-1] * self.V
        
        # Step 2: Relax all edges V-1 times
        for i in range(self.V - 1):
            # Flag to check if any distance was updated
            updated = False
            
            for u, v, weight in self.edges:
                if distances[u] != float('inf') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                    distances[v] = distances[u] + weight
                    parent[v] = u
                    updated = True
            
            # Early termination optimization
            if not updated:
                break
        
        # Step 3: Check for negative cycles
        for u, v, weight in self.edges:
            if distances[u] != float('inf') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                return None, None, "Negative cycle detected"
        
        return distances, parent, "No negative cycle"
    
    def get_shortest_path(self, source, target, parent):
        if parent[target] == -1 and target != source:
            return []
        
        path = []
        current = target
        
        while current != -1:
            path.append(current)
            current = parent[current]
        
        path.reverse()
        return path
    
    def print_solution(self, distances, parent, source):
        print(f"Shortest distances from vertex {source}:")
        for i in range(self.V):
            if distances[i] == float('inf'):
                print(f"Vertex {i}: No path")
            else:
                path = self.get_shortest_path(source, i, parent)
                print(f"Vertex {i}: Distance = {distances[i]}, Path = {' -> '.join(map(str, path))}")

# Example Usage
g = Graph(5)
g.add_edge(0, 1, -1)
g.add_edge(0, 2, 4)
g.add_edge(1, 2, 3)
g.add_edge(1, 3, 2)
g.add_edge(1, 4, 2)
g.add_edge(3, 2, 5)
g.add_edge(3, 1, 1)
g.add_edge(4, 3, -3)

distances, parent, status = g.bellman_ford(0)
if distances:
    g.print_solution(distances, parent, 0)
else:
    print(status)
```

### C++ Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

struct Edge {
    int u, v, weight;
    Edge(int u, int v, int weight) : u(u), v(v), weight(weight) {}
};

class Graph {
    int V;
    vector<Edge> edges;

public:
    Graph(int vertices) : V(vertices) {}
    
    void addEdge(int u, int v, int weight) {
        edges.push_back(Edge(u, v, weight));
    }
    
    pair<vector<int>, bool> bellmanFord(int source) {
        vector<int> dist(V, INT_MAX);
        dist[source] = 0;
        
        // Relax all edges V-1 times
        for (int i = 0; i < V - 1; i++) {
            for (auto& edge : edges) {
                if (dist[edge.u] != INT_MAX && 
                    dist[edge.u] + edge.weight < dist[edge.v]) {
                    dist[edge.v] = dist[edge.u] + edge.weight;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Check for negative cycles
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            if (dist[edge.u] != INT_MAX && 
                dist[edge.u] + edge.weight < dist[edge.v]) {
                return {dist, false}; // Negative cycle detected
            }
        }
        
        return {dist, true}; // No negative cycle
    }
};
```

### Optimized Version with Early Termination:

```python
def bellman_ford_optimized(self, source):
    distances = [float('inf')] * self.V
    distances[source] = 0
    
    for iteration in range(self.V - 1):
        updated = False
        
        for u, v, weight in self.edges:
            if distances[u] != float('inf') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                distances[v] = distances[u] + weight
                updated = True
        
        # If no updates in this iteration, we're done
        if not updated:
            print(f"Converged after {iteration + 1} iterations")
            break
    
    # Check for negative cycles
    for u, v, weight in self.edges:
        if distances[u] != float('inf') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
            return None, "Negative cycle detected"
    
    return distances, "No negative cycle"
```

## Time & Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:
- **Worst Case**: O(V × E) where V = vertices, E = edges
- **Best Case**: O(E) with early termination optimization
- **Average Case**: O(V × E)

### Space Complexity:
- **O(V)** for distance and parent arrays
- **O(E)** for storing edges

### Comparison:
- **Dense graphs** (E ≈ V²): O(V³)
- **Sparse graphs** (E ≈ V): O(V²)

## Examples

### Example 1: Graph with Negative Edges

```
Graph:
    0 ----(-1)---- 1
    |              |
    4             2
    |           /   |
    2 ---(3)--- 2   2
           |        |
           (5)      4
           |      /
           3 --(-3)

Edges: (0,1,-1), (0,2,4), (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (1,4,2), (3,2,5), (3,1,1), (4,3,-3)
Source: 0
```

**Step-by-step execution:**

| Iteration | Edge Relaxed | Distance Array | Updated |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| 0         | -            | [0, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞] | - |
| 1         | (0,1,-1)     | [0, -1, ∞, ∞, ∞] | Yes |
| 1         | (0,2,4)      | [0, -1, 4, ∞, ∞] | Yes |
| 1         | (1,2,3)      | [0, -1, 2, ∞, ∞] | Yes |
| 1         | (1,3,2)      | [0, -1, 2, 1, ∞] | Yes |
| 1         | (1,4,2)      | [0, -1, 2, 1, 1] | Yes |
| 2         | (4,3,-3)     | [0, -1, 2, -2, 1] | Yes |
| 2         | (3,1,1)      | [0, -1, 2, -2, 1] | No |
| 3         | No updates   | [0, -1, 2, -2, 1] | No |

**Final Result:**
- Distance from 0 to 0: 0
- Distance from 0 to 1: -1 (path: 0→1)
- Distance from 0 to 2: 2 (path: 0→1→2)
- Distance from 0 to 3: -2 (path: 0→1→4→3)
- Distance from 0 to 4: 1 (path: 0→1→4)

### Example 2: Graph with Negative Cycle

```
Graph with negative cycle:
    0 ----1---- 1
              / |
            -3  2
           /    |
          2 ----1---- 3

Edges: (0,1,1), (1,2,2), (2,1,-3), (1,3,1), (2,3,1)
```

The cycle 1→2→1 has weight: 2 + (-3) = -1 (negative cycle)

## Negative Cycle Detection

### Why is Negative Cycle Detection Important?

1. **Shortest Path Undefined**: In presence of negative cycles, shortest path is not well-defined
2. **Infinite Improvement**: Distances can be improved indefinitely
3. **Real-world Applications**: Arbitrage detection in finance, finding inconsistencies

### Detection Method:

After V-1 iterations, if we can still relax any edge, there's a negative cycle:

```python
def detect_negative_cycle(self, source):
    distances, _, status = self.bellman_ford(source)
    
    if distances is None:
        return True  # Negative cycle detected
    
    return False

def find_negative_cycle_vertices(self, source):
    distances = [float('inf')] * self.V
    distances[source] = 0
    
    # Run V-1 iterations
    for _ in range(self.V - 1):
        for u, v, weight in self.edges:
            if distances[u] != float('inf') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                distances[v] = distances[u] + weight
    
    # Find vertices affected by negative cycle
    cycle_vertices = set()
    for u, v, weight in self.edges:
        if distances[u] != float('inf') and distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
            cycle_vertices.add(v)
    
    return list(cycle_vertices)
```

2. **Negative Cycle Detection**: Can identify and report negative cycles
3. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
4. **Versatility**: Works with any graph structure

## Comparison with Dijkstra

| Aspect | Dijkstra | Bellman-Ford |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Time Complexity** | O((V+E)logV) | O(VE) |
| **Negative Weights** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Negative Cycle Detection** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Graph Type** | Weighted, non-negative | Weighted, any weights |
| **Algorithm Type** | Greedy | Dynamic Programming |
| **Memory Usage** | O(V) | O(V) |
| **Use Case** | Fast shortest path | Negative weights, cycle detection |

### When to Use Which:

**Use Dijkstra when:**
- All edge weights are non-negative
- Performance is critical
- Large graphs with many vertices

**Use Bellman-Ford when:**
- Graph has negative edge weights
- Need to detect negative cycles
- Graph is relatively small
- Robustness is more important than speed

## Variations

### 1. **SPFA (Shortest Path Faster Algorithm)**
- Optimization of Bellman-Ford using queue
- Average case: O(E), Worst case: O(VE)
- More efficient in practice

```python
def spfa(self, source):
    distances = [float('inf')] * self.V
    distances[source] = 0
    in_queue = [False] * self.V
    queue = [source]
    in_queue[source] = True
    
    while queue:
        u = queue.pop(0)
        in_queue[u] = False
        
        for v, weight in self.adj[u]:
            if distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                distances[v] = distances[u] + weight
                if not in_queue[v]:
                    queue.append(v)
                    in_queue[v] = True
    
    return distances
```

### 2. **Yen's Algorithm**
- For finding K shortest paths
- Combines Dijkstra and path deviation

### 3. **Eppstein's Algorithm**
- K shortest paths in O(E + V log V + K)
- More efficient for multiple path queries
