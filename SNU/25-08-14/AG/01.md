## Introduction
I
**Dijkstra's Algorithm** is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Greedy Algorithm**: Makes locally optimal choices at each step
- **Single-Source Shortest Path**: Finds shortest paths from one source to all other vertices
- **Works with**: Non-negative weighted graphs only
- **Graph Type**: Works with both directed and undirected graphs

## Problem Statement

Given a weighted graph and a source vertex, find the shortest distance from the source to all other vertices in the graph.

### Constraints:
- All edge weights must be **non-negative**
- Graph can be directed or undirected
- Graph must be connected (for meaningful results)

## Algorithm Overview

### Core Idea:
1. Start from the source vertex
2. Maintain distances to all vertices (initially infinity except source = 0)
3. Always select the unvisited vertex with minimum distance
4. Update distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found
5. Mark the vertex as visited
6. Repeat until all vertices are processed

### Data Structures Used:
- **Distance Array**: Stores shortest distance from source to each vertex
- **Visited Array**: Tracks which vertices have been processed
- **Priority Queue/Min-Heap**: Efficiently gets the vertex with minimum distance

## Step-by-Step Process

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Initialize**:
   - Set distance to source = 0
   - Set distance to all other vertices = ‚àû
   - Mark all vertices as unvisited
   - Create a priority queue with all vertices

2. **Main Loop**:
   ```
   While there are unvisited vertices:
       a. Select unvisited vertex 'u' with minimum distance
       b. Mark 'u' as visited
       c. For each unvisited neighbor 'v' of 'u':
          - Calculate new_distance = distance[u] + weight(u,v)
          - If new_distance < distance[v]:
              distance[v] = new_distance
              parent[v] = u  (for path reconstruction)
   ```

3. **Result**: Distance array contains shortest distances from source to all vertices

## Implementation

### Python Implementation (Using Priority Queue):

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = defaultdict(list)
        self.vertices = 0
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v, weight):
        self.graph[u].append((v, weight))
        self.vertices = max(self.vertices, max(u, v) + 1)
    
    def dijkstra(self, source):
        # Initialize distances and visited array
        distances = [float('inf')] * self.vertices
        distances[source] = 0
        visited = [False] * self.vertices
        parent = [-1] * self.vertices
        
        # Priority queue: (distance, vertex)
        pq = [(0, source)]
        
        while pq:
            current_dist, u = heapq.heappop(pq)
            
            # Skip if already visited
            if visited[u]:
                continue
                
            visited[u] = True
            
            # Check all neighbors
            for neighbor, weight in self.graph[u]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    new_distance = current_dist + weight
                    
                    if new_distance < distances[neighbor]:
                        distances[neighbor] = new_distance
                        parent[neighbor] = u
                        heapq.heappush(pq, (new_distance, neighbor))
        
        return distances, parent
    
    def get_shortest_path(self, source, target, parent):
        path = []
        current = target
        
        while current != -1:
            path.append(current)
            current = parent[current]
        
        path.reverse()
        return path if path[0] == source else []

# Example Usage
g = Graph()
g.add_edge(0, 1, 4)
g.add_edge(0, 2, 1)
g.add_edge(2, 1, 2)
g.add_edge(1, 3, 1)
g.add_edge(2, 3, 5)

distances, parent = g.dijkstra(0)
print("Shortest distances from vertex 0:", distances)
print("Shortest path from 0 to 3:", g.get_shortest_path(0, 3, parent))
```

### C++ Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

class Graph {
    int V;
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj;

public:
    Graph(int vertices) : V(vertices) {
        adj.resize(V);
    }
    
    void addEdge(int u, int v, int weight) {
        adj[u].push_back({v, weight});
    }
    
    vector<int> dijkstra(int source) {
        vector<int> dist(V, INT_MAX);
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
        
        dist[source] = 0;
        pq.push({0, source});
        
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            int u = pq.top().second;
            pq.pop();
            
            for (auto& edge : adj[u]) {
                int v = edge.first;
                int weight = edge.second;
                
                if (dist[u] + weight < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight;
                    pq.push({dist[v], v});
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dist;
    }
};
```

## Time & Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:
- **Using Array**: O(V¬≤) where V = number of vertices
- **Using Binary Heap**: O((V + E) log V) where E = number of edges
- **Using Fibonacci Heap**: O(E + V log V)

### Space Complexity:
- **O(V)** for distance array, visited array, and priority queue

### When to use which implementation:
- **Dense graphs** (E ‚âà V¬≤): Array implementation is better
- **Sparse graphs** (E << V¬≤): Heap implementation is better

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Graph

```
Graph:
    0 ----4---- 1
    |          /|
    1        2  |
    |      /    1
    2 ---5----- 3

Source: 0
```

**Step-by-step execution:**

| Step | Current | Distance Array | Visited | Action |
|------|---------|----------------|---------|--------|
| 0    | -       | [0, ‚àû, ‚àû, ‚àû]  | [F,F,F,F] | Initialize |
| 1    | 0       | [0, 4, 1, ‚àû]  | [T,F,F,F] | Process vertex 0 |
| 2    | 2       | [0, 3, 1, 6]  | [T,F,T,F] | Process vertex 2 |
| 3    | 1       | [0, 3, 1, 4]  | [T,T,T,F] | Process vertex 1 |
| 4    | 3       | [0, 3, 1, 4]  | [T,T,T,T] | Process vertex 3 |

**Final Result:**
- Distance from 0 to 0: 0
- Distance from 0 to 1: 3 (path: 0‚Üí2‚Üí1)
- Distance from 0 to 2: 1 (path: 0‚Üí2)
- Distance from 0 to 3: 4 (path: 0‚Üí2‚Üí1‚Üí3)

### Example 2: Larger Graph

```
       2
   0 -----> 1
   |      /   \
   |     /     \ 4
   6   1        \
   |  /          v
   v/            3
   2 ----3-----> 4
```

**Adjacency representation:**
- 0 ‚Üí [(1,2), (2,6)]
- 1 ‚Üí [(2,1), (3,4)]
- 2 ‚Üí [(4,3)]
- 3 ‚Üí [(4,1)]

## Important Notes & Tips

### üö® Common Pitfalls:
1. **Negative weights**: Dijkstra fails with negative edge weights (use Bellman-Ford instead)
2. **Infinite loops**: Can occur if implementation doesn't properly handle visited vertices
3. **Integer overflow**: Use appropriate data types for large weights
4. **Zero-weight cycles**: While allowed, need careful handling

### üí° Optimization Tips:
1. **Early termination**: Stop when target vertex is reached (for single target)
2. **Preprocessing**: Sort adjacency lists by weight for better cache performance
3. **Data structure choice**: Use Fibonacci heap for very sparse graphs
4. **Memory optimization**: Use bit arrays for visited flags

### üîç Debugging Tips:
1. Print distance array at each step
